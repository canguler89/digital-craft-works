<button>About Me!</button>
<body>
    <p>I was born and raised in Turkey. Then, I came to USA and started my first job in Cleveland,OH.
        I started traveling around the U.S. and I met with my wife in Dayton. We started going out. 
        Then, we decided to get married. We had our baby on April, 2018. We moved to Houston, TX in 2019.

        My hobbies are:
        <ul>
            <li>Hiking</li>
            <li>Road trips with my family</li>
            <li>Swimming</li>
            <li>Listening music</li>
            <li>Watching movies</li>
            <li>Playing online games</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>I like dogs but I never find a chance to have one.</p>
    <p>I am always open learning new things. I like to educate myself in areas that I am not familiar.
        That challanges me and gives me a reason to live. Otherwise, I feel like life is meaningless.  
        I do not know the meaning of giving up so I do not give up.
